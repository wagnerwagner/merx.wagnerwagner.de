Text: 

Use the gateway option to add your own payment gateway.

`initializePayment` and `completePayment` must return a (link: docs/classes/orderpage text: `OrderPage`) object.

In `initializePayment` you can set a redirect url. The user will be redirected to this url. If you don’t set `redirect` the user will be sent to (link: docs/options/successpage text: successPage).

(filename: site/content/config.php)

```php
return [
  'ww.merx.gateways' => [
    'my-payment-provider' => [
      'initializePayment' => function(OrderPage $virtualOrderPage): OrderPage
      {
        $sum = $virtualOrderPage->cart()->getSum();
        // do something to get a redirect url
        $redirectUrl = 'https://mypaymentprovider.com/payment/mlDquvqMQK85M1Pw',
        $virtualOrderPage->content()->update([
          'redirect' => $redirectUrl,
        ]);
        return $virtualOrderPage;
      },
      'completePayment' => function(OrderPage $virtualOrderPage, array $data): OrderPage
      {
        $virtualOrderPage->content()->update([
          'paymentComplete' => true,
          'payedDate' => date('c'),
        ]);
        return $virtualOrderPage;
      }
    ],
  ],
];
```

Be careful. Since `$virtualOrderPage` is just virtual and not yet written to the content folder you can't use [`$page->update()`](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/objects/page/update) (which would write a content file). Instead you can use [`$page->content()->update()`](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/@/cms/content/update) to update the virtual page’s content.
